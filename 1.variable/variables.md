# Declare a variable

1. Use `var` key word, followed by name and type.

- Variables are declared inside a function.
- GO has 3 basic data types: bool, Numeric, string.
- Numeric data types are : int, uint, float32, float64.
- If not specified, the `float` data type is `float64`.
- strings are surrounded by double quote signs.

2. Use `:=` sign, follow by value

- Go will infer the type according to system default.
- To assign a value to the variable, we use `=` operrand.

3. Multiple variables assignment:

- In go we can assign va lueto multiple variable at once.
- Check the related code for further instruction.

4. To create a const variable, use `const` instead of `var`.
